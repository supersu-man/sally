                Calculating the exact amounts each person owes and the necessary transactions to settle shared expenses can be a complex and tedious task, often requiring spreadsheets. This complexity increases when some community expenses are not shared by everyone (for example, if one friend didnâ€™t join the museum trip paid by another for the group).
